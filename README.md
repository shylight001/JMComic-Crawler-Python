   git clone https://github.com/shylight001/JMComic-Crawler-Python.git
   cd JMComic-Crawler-Python
   ```

2. Set Up a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):

   call C:\path\to\new\virtual\environment\Scripts\activate.bat
   ```

3. Install Dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Create `option.yml` based on `option.example.yml`. Download path, login credentials are set here. For further option configuration, please refer to [option_file_syntax.md](https://github.com/hect0x7/JMComic-Crawler-Python/blob/master/assets/docs/sources/option_file_syntax.md) by [hect0x7](https://github.com/hect0x7)

5. Create `update_list.json` based on `update_list.example.json`.
   `FolderList` field can be left empty since it is fetched from your favourite folder account in JMComic.
   A typical manga title in `UpdateList`:
   ```JSON
    "manga_ID": {
      "photo_id": "latest_chapter_ID",
      "title": "manga_title",
      "completed": false, //If the manga is completed or not. If completed, then downloader won't check updates for this title
      "first_download": false, //If it is the first time to download the title, all chapters will be downloaded until the latest chapters. Otherwise just check updates on this title.
      "folder_id": "folder_id" //This shows which favourite folder this title belongs to
    },
   ```

## Usage

To start the plugin, run the following command:

```bash
python C:\path\to\new\virtual\environment\main.py
```

Or you can create `run_script.bat` based on `run_script.example.bat`, which is for Windows Task Scheduler to run regularly.

## Output

Downloaded manga chapters are saved in the specified output directory, with each manga title saved in its own folder. The plugin can output and update title data in `update_list.json` file. A log file will generate in `logs` folder after each download for user to verify if the chapters have been downloaded successfully.
